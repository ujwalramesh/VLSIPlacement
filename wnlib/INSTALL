  we have found to be useful in our programming practices.

DOWNLOADING and INSTALLATION:

1)  Create a directory called "wnlib" wherever you want this code to
    reside and go into it.  Type

      $ cd <directory where wnlib is to reside>
      $ mkdir wnlib
      $ cd wnlib

2)  Download the gzip file wnlib.tar.gz into the wnlib directory
    from the website www.willnaylor.com/wnlib.html

3)  Decompress the downloaded file

      $ gunzip wnlib.tar.gz

    'gunzip' can be obtained from www.gzip.org or www.gnu.org

4)  Untar the file

      $ tar xvf wnlib.tar

5)  Build the code.  Type

      $ make all

    from the wnlib directory.

    If this fails, it may be necessary to modify variables in acc/makefile
    to fit the platform you are running on.  Be sure your makefiles should
    by default be using the -I switch of cc (or equivalent) to include the
    .h files.

6)  When you believe you have compiled correctly, type

      $ make selftest

    to run the self-testing diagnostics.  If selftest runs successfully
    to completion with no error messages, you have successfully installed
    wnlib.

7)  Extensive man pages, over 70 of them, are to be found in doc/man once
    you have built.  The script "wnman" in the directory "command" is a
    convenient way to view these man pages.  To set it up, do the following

    a)	copy or link wnman into your $PATH somewhere

    b)	set the environment variable $EDITOR to your favorite editor (usually
	vi or emacs), and the environment variable WNLIB to your wnlib
	directory.
	    For example, in bash and sh, add the lines to your login
	startup file

		EDITOR=emacs
		export EDITOR
		WNLIB=<path to wnlib directory>
		export WNLIB

	or in csh, add

		setenv EDITOR=emacs
		setenv WNLIB=<path to wnlib directory>

    wnman will work similarly to the "man" command when invoked from the
    shell.  Unfortunately, the man pages are not integrated well with the
    emacs "manual-entry" command.  If the wnman command is called from
    an emacs shell, it will just output the full name of the file for you
    to cut and paste to open the file.

    Type "wnman <page_name>" to view a man page.  The command
    "wnman -k <keyword>" does a keyword search on all the wnlib man pages.

USE:

A)  Summary: After building,

    ARCHIVE is at:              wnlib/acc/text.a
    H FILES are at:             wnlib/acc/h/*.h
    MAN PAGES are at:           wnlib/doc/man/*.man
      main html man page:	wnlib/doc/mantext/main_man.html

B)  Under wnlib, after building, the directory "acc" contains the archive
    file to link to.  The directory acc/h contains links to all of the
    .h files.  See the makefile's in the acc subdirectories building
    selftests and examples for examples of linking text.a files and
    including .h files.
