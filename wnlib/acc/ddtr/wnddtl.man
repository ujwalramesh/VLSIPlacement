NAME
     wnddtl -- create dd tree for common kinds of keys

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wnddtl.h"

     wn_mkintddtree(&tree,num_dimensions)
     wn_ddtree tree;
     int num_dimensions;

     wn_mkdoubleddtree(&tree,num_dimensions)
     wn_btree tree;
     int num_dimensions;

DESCRIPTION
     "wn_mkdoublebtree" allocates a dd tree indexed by double keys.
     A "double" is a long floating-point number.

     It should be noted that when working with this package in the
     integer case, "key" is a pointer to a vector of ints.  With
     doubles, "key" is a pointer to a vector of POINTERS TO doubles.
