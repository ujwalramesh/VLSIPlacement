NAME
     wnskll -- create skip list for common kinds of keys

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wnskpl.h"

     void wn_mkstrsklist(wn_sklist &sklist, double threshold)

     void wn_mkintsklist(wn_sklist &sklist, double threshold)

     void wn_mkdoublesklist(wn_sklist &sklist, double threshold)

DESCRIPTION
     "wn_mkstrsklist" allocates a skip list indexed by null-terminated char
     strings (from the current memory group).

     "wn_mkintsklist" allocates a skip list indexed by int keys.

     "wn_mkdoublesklist" allocates a skip list indexed by double keys.
     A "double" is a long floating-point number.  You should 
     pass "&number" rather than just "number" as the key.
