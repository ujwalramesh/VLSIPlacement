NAME
     wnrndt -- true random numbers

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wnrndt.h"

     int wn_true_random_int(void)

     int wn_true_random_bit(void)

DESCRIPTION
     These routines generate true random numbers by XOR-ing together
     bits from /usr/spool/news.  They are much slower than routines
     for pseudo-random numbers in wnrnd, and they fail when /usr/spool/news
     runs out of bits.
