NAME
     wnbtrl -- create sorted tree for common kinds of keys

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wnbtrl.h"

     void wn_mkstrbtree(wn_btree &tree)

     void wn_mkintbtree(wn_btree &tree)

     void wn_mkdoublebtree(wn_btree &tree)

DESCRIPTION
     "wn_mkstrbtree" allocates a sorted tree indexed by null-terminated char
     strings (from the current memory group).

     "wn_mkintbtree" allocates a sorted tree indexed by int keys.

     "wn_mkdoublebtree" allocates a sorted tree indexed by double keys.
     A "double" is a long floating-point number.  You should 
     pass "&number" rather than just "number" as the key.
