NAME
     wnspmat -- sparse matrix data structures and operations

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wnspmat.h"

     typedef struct wn_sparse_matrix_struct
     {
       int len_i,len_j;
       wn_sll *i_lists,*j_lists;  /* list of entries */
     
       wn_memgp group;
     } *wn_sparse_matrix;
     
     typedef struct wn_sparse_matrix_entry_struct
     {
       double value;
     
       int i,j;
     
       ptr baggage;
     } *wn_sparse_matrix_entry;
     
DESCRIPTION
     The include file "wnlib/cc/matrix/wnspmat.h" defines the sparse matrix
     structures above.  Sparse matrix subroutines defined in "wnlib/cc/spmat"
     provide the following types of sparse matrix operations:

         - creation (see wnspmk)
         - input and output (see wnspio)
         - various optimization algorithms


     "len_i" refers to the number of rows or height of the sparse matrix;
     "len_j" refers to the number of columns or width of the sparse matrix.

     Other man pages refer to sparse matrix entry row i, column j as
     "sparse_matrix[i][j]".  This array indexing cannot be
     performed on sparse matrices in C, although it makes a nice
     shorthand for use in man pages.

EXAMPLES
     Look in "wnlib/cc/spmat/examples.c" for examples of sparse matrix code.

BUGS
     Much of this code is not extensively tested.
