NAME
     wneq -- functions which determine equality (for hash tables)

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wneq.h"

     bool wn_streq(char s1[],char s2[])

     bool wn_streqnc(char s1[],char s2[])

     bool wn_inteq(int i1,int i2)

     bool wn_ptreq(ptr p1,ptr p2)

     bool wn_ptrNULLeq(bool &success,ptr p1,ptr p2)

     bool wn_memeq(ptr m1,ptr m2,int len)

DESCRIPTION
     These routines are designed to assist building hash tables (with 
     the exception of wn_streqnc).  They determine whether their arguments
     are equal or not, and return TRUE if equal, FALSE if not equal.

     "wn_ptrNULLeq" sets "success" to TRUE iff "p1" or "p2" is NULL.
     If "p1" and "p2" are NULL, it returns TRUE.  If "p1" is NULL but
     "p2" is not NULL, it returns FALSE.  If "p1" is not NULL but
     "p2" is NULL, it returns FALSE.  This function is useful for
     constructing complicated linked structure equality tests where it 
     is possible for some pointers to be NULL.

     "wn_streqnc" ignores case.
