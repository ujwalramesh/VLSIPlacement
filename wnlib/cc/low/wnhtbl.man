NAME
     wnhtbl -- make hash tables for common kinds of keys

SYNOPSIS
     wn_mkhashhtab(&table)
     wn_htab table;

     wn_mkstrhtab(&table)
     wn_htab table;

     wn_mkptrhtab(&table)
     wn_htab table;

     wn_mkinthtab(&table)
     wn_htab table;

DESCRIPTION
     "wn_mkhashhtab" allocates a hash table that assumes the key
     is already hashed (from the current memory group).

     "wn_mkstrhtab" allocates a hash table indexed by null-terminated char
     strings (from the current memory group).

     "wn_mkptrhtab" allocates a hash table indexed by pointer keys, that
     is, by the value of the pointer itself (as opposed to what the
     pointer points to).

     "wn_mkinthtab" allocates a hash table indexed by int keys.
