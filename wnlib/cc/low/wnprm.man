NAME
     wnprm -- permutation package

SYNOPSIS
     #include "wnprm.h"

     wn_random_permutation(permutation,size)
     int permutation[],size;

     wn_identity_permutation(permutation,size)
     int permutation[],size;

     wn_permute_permutation(result,perm1,perm2,size)
     int result[],perm1[],perm2[],size;

     wn_permute_array(result,permutation,array,size)
     object_type result[],array[];
     int permutation[],size;

     wn_invert_permutation(inverse,permutation,size)
     int inverse[],permutation[],size;

     bool wn_is_valid_permutation(permutation,size)
     int permutation[],size;

DESCRIPTION
     This package produces and operates on permutations.  A permutation
     is an int array of size "size".  It contains the ints 0 to size-1
     in some order.  A permutation defines a reordering of an
     array of objects of size "size"; the permutation array entry
     value defines where the reordered object comes from.

     "wn_random_permutation" produces a random permutation using
     "wn_random_int_between".

     "wn_identity_permutation" produces the identity permutation, that
     is, [0 1 2 3 ... size-1].  This permutation produces no reordering.

     "wn_permute_permutation" applies permutation "perm1"
     to "perm2", placing the result in "result".  Since entries of
     "result" change during execution, "result" must not overlap with
     "perm1" or "perm2".

     "wn_permute_array" is a macro which applies permutation
     "permutation" to "array", placing the result in "result".
     The arrays "result" and "array" must be of the same type.
     Since entries of "result" change during execution, "result" must
     not overlap with "permutation" or "array".

     "wn_invert_permutation" inverts permutation "permutation",
     placing the result in "inverse".  Since entries of "inverse" 
     change during execution, "inverse" must not 
     overlap with "permutation".

     "wn_is_valid_permutation" returns TRUE if "permutation" is
     a valid permutation; otherwise it returns FALSE.

EXAMPLES

RESOURCES
     "wn_random_permutation" and "wn_is_valid_permutation" run with

       WORST and AVERAGE CASE:
     
         time = n
         stack memory = 1
         dynamic memory = n

     "wn_identity_permutation", "wn_permute_permutation", "wn_permute_array",
     and "wn_invert_permutation" run with

       WORST and AVERAGE CASE:
     
         time = n
         stack memory = 1
         dynamic memory = 0

     In the above, n is "size", the size of the permutation.
