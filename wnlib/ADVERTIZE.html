<div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Announcing wnlib 9.0, public domain library
of ansi C routines</span></big></big><br>
</big></div>
<big><br>
wnlib has existed for about 10 years now, and has been used extensively
in industry during that time.&nbsp; We are announcing the new 9.0
release, which has just announced Windows support.<br>
<br>
wnlib is in the public domain, so there are no legal strings attached
-- you can modify the code, you can sell it, you just have to keep in
the comments saying it is in the public domain and leave the authors'
names in the comments (though you can add your own name there if you
make changes).&nbsp; We ask (but do not demand) that you make your
improvements available to us for merging, to avoid multiple copies
floating around.<br>
<br>
wnlib compiles without errors as ansi C as of the 89, 94, and 99
standards, and as C++.&nbsp; It supports Sun Solaris, Linux, Cygwin,
and Windows.&nbsp; We have a report that it's been ported to MAC OSX
with a very small amount of work.<br>
<br>
The code comes with 86 files of text documentation similar to the unix
man pages.&nbsp; For a master html page with links to all these text
man pages, look at
<a href="doc/mantext/main_man.html">doc/mantext/main_man.html</a>
.<br>
<br>
Most of the code also comes with selftest programs that test it.&nbsp;
So if you build wnlib on your machine, you can then run the selftests
and have a high degree of confidence that the code is OK.<br>
<br>
Each package comes with an examples program, to supplement the
documentation.<br>
<br>
wnlib contains over 550 subroutines for various purposes, 45,000 lines
of code in 173 files.&nbsp; In addition to that, there are 6100 lines
of selftest code in 25 files, and 5800 lines of examples code in 25
files.<br>
<br>
wnlib
has the
following utilities:<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Group (or pool) Memory Allocation
</span></big>:
Allocate your memory in groups, then you can free complex data
structures with a single (and fast) subroutine call, rather than having
to visit and free every struct.&nbsp; Memory segments can be freed and
reused within a group.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Asserts</span></big>: Better than
&lt;assert.h&gt; - can specify some asserts that happen during your
debugging, but are conditionally compiled into nothing when you are
building for your product.&nbsp; At the same time, there are other
asserts that are guaranteed to always take place.&nbsp; You can also
define your own assert handler, in case you want the output of your
asserts to go to a message box in a GUI.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Argument Parser</span>
</big>:
just declare your arguments in a table, and this command line parser
will parse them from the command line, and bombs with a usage message
if the user types them in wrong.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Containers</span></big>: various
datastructures for storing pointers to objects:<br>
</big>
<ul>
  <big> <li>linked list with index, reverse order, copy, count,
randomize, and concatenate functions, among others</li>
  <li>binary tree, height-balanced</li>
  <li>skip list, can be configured
to have the memory requirements similar to a linked list and/or the
lookup speed and sorting qualities of a binary tree.</li>
  <li>bit vector - store an array
of bits, with boolean operations available between vectors.</li>
  <li>hash tables (2 kinds)</li>
  <li>ddtrees - store points in a
binary tree sorted by n-space, quickly traverse points within a given
range</li>
  <li>priority queue</li>
  </big>
</ul>
<big><br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Random numbers</span></big>, much
higher cryptographic quality than unix random numbers.&nbsp; Various
distributions, including integer within a range, double precision
within a range, normal distribution, exponential distribution, poisson
distribution, cauchy distribution.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sorts</span></big>:<br>
</big>
<ul>
  <li><big>quick sort: better than unix qsort, performance is still
n*log n on
already sorted data.<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>merge sort<br>
    </big></li>
  <li><big>radix sort (very fast, O(n))<br>
    </big></li>
</ul>
<big><br>
double precision <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vectors</span></big>:
copy, dot product, addition, multiply by scalar, norm, unit vector,
random.<br>
<br>
double precision <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Matrices</span></big>:
copy, invert, random, transpose, simplex method, gramm-schmitt,
multiply by vector, matrix multiplication<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sparse Matrices</span></big>:
critical path, min-cost / max-flow, longest path (critical path
allowing cycles), shortest path, transportation problem.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Strings</span></big>: allocate
and duplicate a string (using the group memory allocator), concatenate
2-6 strings, allocating the result with the group memory allocator.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Fourier Transforms</span></big><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small>General </small><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simulated
Annealing</span></big><small> package</small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conjugate-Gradient and
Conjugate-Direction</span></big><small> algorithms<br>
