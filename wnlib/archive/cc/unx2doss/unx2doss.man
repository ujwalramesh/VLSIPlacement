NAME
     unx2doss -- program for translating text file from unix format to dos
		 format

SYNOPSIS
        unx2doss <list of files>

DESCRIPTION
  	This program will translate all the files whose names are
    given on the command line from unix format (lines ending with
    \n) to dos format (lines ending with \r\n).  It assumes no one
    wants to put a \r anywhere without a following \n, which is
    the case for text files.
  	This program will work when run on unix or on dos.
  	Note that if this program is run on a file that is already
    in dos format, no changes will be made to the file, so you
    don't have to worry about accidentally running it twice on
    the same file.

        Note this program uses "unx2doss.tmp" in the current
    directory as a temporary file, and will destroy one there if
    if finds it.

SEE ALSO

	There is also unx2doss.pl, which is a perl script that does
    exactly the same thing, if you have perl working on your system
    (unx2doss is provided as a .exe for windows users who might not
    have perl available).
