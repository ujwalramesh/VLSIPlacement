NAME
	wnmake1

SYNOPSYS
	wnmake1 <main program source file> <other source files>

wnmake1 is useful when writing small programs that will use wnlib,
saving you the trouble of making a makefile.

Say you have a main program a1.c, and you want to build it
along with c files b4.c and b5.c, and you want them all built including
the wnlib include directory in the include path, and you want them
all linked together with wnlib.  Just say

	wnmake1 a1.c b4.c b5.c

and all 3 c files will be compiled and linked with $WNLIB/acc/text.a.
The resulting program will be named "a1".

    Note this uses make, and rebuilds only as needed.  Suppose, for
example, a1.c and b4.c have already been compiled and b5.c has not,
then only b5.c will be recompiled.

    Note for this script to work, you need to define the environment
variable $WNLIB as the root of your wnlib file tree (that's how it finds
the include directory and the wnlib text.a file).
