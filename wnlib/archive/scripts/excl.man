NAME
      excl.pl - program for excluding filenames from a list of filenames

SYNOPSIS
      excl.pl <list> - <exclude list>

DESCRIPTION
    the file outputs the strings in <list>, one per line, except
    for those strings that are in <exclude list>.
      Note it is OK to have strings in <exclude list> that are
    not in <list>.

      For example, if you are in the wnlib/acc/low directory and want to
    see all that c files that don't begin with "wn".  You say

      ls `excl.pl *.c - wn*`

    and the output is

      examples.c  selftest.c	xlateasrt.c

      Another thing you might want to do is look at everything in
    your directory except objects, archives, and emacs backups (which end with
    '~').  You say

      ls -F `excl.pl * - *.o *.a *~`

    and you get

    examples*      makefile*      wnabs.h     wncons.h   wnnop.c   wnsqr.man
    examples.c     manscript.csh* wnabs.man   wnerr.h    wnnop.h   wnswap.h
    filemerge.out% selftest*      wnasrt.c    wnlib.h    wnnop.man wnswap.man
    hscript.csh*   selftest.c     wnasrt.h    wnmax.h    wnport.h  xlateasrt*
    lf*            ve*            wnasrt.man  wnmax.man  wnsqr.h   xlateasrt.c
