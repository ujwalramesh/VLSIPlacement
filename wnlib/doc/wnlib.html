<P>
This web page gives you access to the WNLIB subroutine
library, which is a free, unrestricted ANSI C subroutine library
which includes numerical routines such as
conjugate-gradient and conjugate-directions, simplex
method, transportation problem, fast-Fourier
transform, matrix and vector operations;
data structure packages such as linked list,
balanced binary tree, completely general
hash table with common hash functions,
dd tree, sorting for lists and arrays;
very good pseudo-random number generator,
also a true random number generator;
improved memory allocator with memory debugger;
parsing package; much more.

During the past 15 years of C programming, 
<!--
<A HREF="index.html">I (Will Naylor, the author)</A>, 
-->
the authors (<A HREF="index.html">Will Naylor</A> and 
Bill Chapman) have accumulated a large library of
subroutines which we have found most useful in quickly writing fast, portable,
clean C programs.  We call this library "WNLIB", and we are now 
making it available to everybody, free of charge or restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The system includes:

    <A HREF="mantext/main_man.html#matrix">matrix</A> 
    and 
    <A HREF="mantext/main_man.html#vector">vector</A>

    </A> 
<LI>
    <A HREF="mantext/main_man.html#random">
    very good pseudo-random number generator.  
    </A> 
    Also a routine to generate
    true random numbers (no kidding!).  Normal distribution,
    Poisson distribution, Cauchy distribution, etc.
<LI>unconstrained non-linear optimization routines:
