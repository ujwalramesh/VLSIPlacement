<H1>Downloading and Installing WNLIB for unix users.  <small><small>Windows user click <A HREF="download_windows.html">here</A></small></small></H1>
<P>
To retrieve and build WNLIB, follow these instructions:
</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Create a directory called "wnlib" wherever you want this code to
   reside and go into it.  Type
<PRE>
     $ cd &lt; directory where wnlib is to reside &gt;
     $ mkdir wnlib
     $ cd wnlib
</PRE>
<LI> Download wnlib.tar.gz by clicking
<A HREF="wnlib.tar.gz">here</A> (say "save it to disk").
This gzipfile contains about 1.5 Mbytes of data compressed.  You will need about 30M of free disk space to build everything.
<LI> Decode the gz file.  Type
<PRE>
     $ gunzip wnlib.tar.gz
</PRE>
    you probably have 'gunzip', if you don't, it can be
    obtained from http://www.gzip.org or http://www.gnu.org.
<LI> Un-tar the code.  Type
<PRE>
     $ tar xvf wnlib.tar
</PRE>
<LI> Compile the code.  Type
<PRE>
     $ make all
</PRE>
<LI> If this fails, it may be necessary to modify variables in acc/makefile
to fit the platform you are running on.
<LI>When you believe you have compiled correctly, type
<PRE>
     $ make selftest
</PRE>
to run the self-testing diagnostics.  If selftest runs successfully
to completion with no error messages, you have successfully installed
WNLIB.
</OL>

<LI>  Summary:
<PRE>
    ARCHIVE is in:      wnlib/acc/text.a
    H FILES are in:     wnlib/acc/h/*.h
    MAN PAGES are in:   wnlib/doc/man/*.man 
</PRE>
<LI> Under wnlib, the directory "acc" contains .h files to include and archive
    files to link to.  The directory acc/h contains links to all of the 
    .h files.  The directory acc contains an archive file called "text.a".  
    Use the -I switch
    of cc to include the .h files.  See the makefile's in acc for examples
    of linking text.a files and including .h files.
<LI> <P>man pages are to be found in doc/man.  The script "wnman" in the
    directory "command" is a convenient way to view these man pages.
    Type "wnman <page_name>" to view a man page.
    The command "wnman -k <keyword>" does a keyword search on all
    the man pages.
    </P>
    <P> 
    The variable "wnlib" must point to your wnlib directory for
    wnman to work.  A csh command of the form
    <PRE>
      $ set wnlib = xxx/yyy/wnlib
    </PRE>
    sets this up.  Include such a command in your .cshrc.
