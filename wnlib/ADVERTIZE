WNLIB 9.0 is now available for download.
During my 15 years of C programming, I have accumulated a large library of
subroutines which I have found most useful in quickly writing fast, portable,
clean C programs.  I am now making it available to all, with no usage
restrictions.

Of particular interest to readers of this newsgroup:

  - various matrix and vector routines.

  - very good pseudo-random number generator.  Also a routine to generate
    true random numbers (no kidding!).  Normal distribution,
    Poisson distribution, Cauchy distribution, etc.

  - unconstrained non-linear optimization routines:  implementation of
    conjugate-gradient and conjugate-directions algorithms.

  - constrained non-linear optimization routines:  based on conjugate-gradient
    algorithm with penalties.

  - simplex method for linear programming:  contains anti-cycling and numerical
    stability hacks.  No optimization for sparse matrix.

  - transportation problem/assignment problem routine:  optimization for
    sparse matrix.

  - fast Fourier transform routines.

  - general simulated annealing routine

  - improved memory allocator and memory debugger; parsing package

  - data structures: linked list; balanced binary tree; 
    hash table - with common hash functions; dd tree

  - sorting for lists and arrays

Happy hacking!
